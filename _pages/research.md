"Rewards and Consumption in the Credit Card Market" (***job market paper***, [draft](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4497019))
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Reward programs are often a prominent feature of credit cards. Collaborating with a leading bank in China, I combine proprietary consumer-level data and a survey to study the causal effect of rewards on consumption and consumers' subjective expectations. I leverage a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design to show that a more generous reward design causes consumption increases across both reward-earning and non-reward-earning categories. Applying the fuzzy RD to the survey data, I find that consumers correctly anticipate the impact of reward design on reward-earning consumption but underestimate its effect on total consumption. Using a stylized model, I study the implications of this misperception for market structure and welfare. My calibration results show that consumer misperceptions incentivize banks to offer more generous rewards, which ultimately diminishes market efficiency and leads to a cross-subsidy from less to more sophisticated consumers.

"A Structural Model of Learning before Choice," with T. Tony Ke and J. Miguel Villas-Boas (draft available upon request)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Before making a choice, individuals gradually gather information on the different possible alternatives. Analysts may observe how long the individuals gather information on each alternative when individuals switch from gathering information on one alternative to gathering information on another alternative, and when individuals make a final choice. We develop an empirical model of this choice process, endogenizing the choice of which alternative the individual obtains information from at each point, and estimate the model with data from eye-tracking experiments. The empirical analysis yields empirical estimates of the relative size of search costs, switching costs, and informativeness of search for information. We then study the counterfactual of having lower search costs and switching costs, estimating the effect of a greater length of time to make a decision and a greater number of attention switches across alternatives. The model also delivers that there is a positive correlation between attention to an alternative and the likelihood of that alternative being chosen, through the individuals choosing to learn more about the alternatives for which the individuals have beliefs of a higher preference.

"Interest Rate Misperception and Excess Borrowing in the Consumer Credit Market," with Xiao Yin ([draft](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4256372))
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Credit cards are usually advertised as financial products of conspicuous quality but with shrouded borrowing costs. We elicit consumer perceptions about the interest rate associated with credit-card borrowing. Combining bank account data and surveys, we find that consumers have very noisy perceptions about the true interest costs associated with credit card debt. Total borrowing decreases with perceived interest rates only for those with negative perception errors. Using an information treatment that informs the true costs of credit-card borrowing, we find that every percentage point decrease in the perceived rate increases borrowing by 143.1 US dollars.
