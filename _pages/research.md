"Rewards and Consumption in the Credit Card Market" (***job market paper***, draft coming soon)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
(Preliminary) Many consumers use credit cards for perks and services. Combining consumer-level data, surveys, and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, I identify the effect of credit card rewards on consumption. Platinum-card rewards cause consumers to increase reward-earning spending by 64 US dollars for 15 dollars of rewards. Non-reward-earning spending rises by 54 dollars in the meantime, suggesting a positive spillover effect of rewards on other consumption categories. Opting for Platinum rewards, consumers correctly expect the forthcoming increase in reward-earning spending but only foresee 17 out of a 118-dollar increase in total spending. Complementarity ignorance sheds light on the spillover effect: naive consumers plan to save money through rewards but are unaware of the complementary consumption related to the redeemed rewards in the non-reward-earning category. I use a model to show how complementarity ignorance causes naive consumers to have excess spending, which subsidizes both sophisticated consumers and the bank.

"A Structural Model of Learning before Choice," with T. Tony Ke and J. Miguel Villas-Boas (draft coming soon)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
(Preliminary) Consumers usually sequentially gather information before purchase decisions. We consider a Bayesian decision-maker choosing two alternatives with uncertain payoffs where she decides the learning effort among the products as well as the optimal stopping time. We leverage a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, proximal policy optimization (PPO), to solve the Markov decision process and utilize the corresponding optimal control to estimate the structural parameters of a decision-maker. These processes are helpful for marketers to design and evaluate shopping platforms and advertising strategies.

"Interest Rate Misperception and Excess Borrowing in the Consumer Credit Market," with Xiao Yin ([draft](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4256372))
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Credit cards are usually advertised as financial products of conspicuous quality but with shrouded borrowing costs. We elicit consumer perceptions about the interest rate associated with credit-card borrowing. Combining bank account data and surveys, we find that consumers have very noisy perceptions about the true interest costs associated with credit card debt. Total borrowing decreases with perceived interest rates only for those with negative perception errors. Using an information treatment that informs the true costs of credit-card borrowing, we find that every percentage point decrease in the perceived rate increases borrowing by 143.1 US dollars.
