"Rewards and Consumption in the Credit Card Market" (***job market paper***, draft availble upon request)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Rewards are a prominent feature of credit cards. Collaborating with a leading bank in China, I combine proprietary consumer-level data and a tailored survey to study the causal effect of rewards on consumption and consumers' subjective expectations. I leverage a fuzzy regression discontinuity design and elucidate that rewards cause consumers to increase consumption across both reward-earning and non-reward-earning categories. Notably, consumers tend to underestimate this spending increase in response to rewards. When initiating reward-associated purchases, consumers often overlook their future demand for complementary products in the non-reward-earning category. This misperception, in equilibrium, increases credit card rewards and engenders a welfare disparity: sophisticated consumers benefit from those rewards cross-subsidized by the mistakes of naive consumers.

"A Structural Model of Learning before Choice," with T. Tony Ke and J. Miguel Villas-Boas (draft coming soon)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Before making a choice, individuals gradually gather information on the different possible al- ternatives. Analysts may observe how long the individuals gather information on each alternative, when individuals switch from gathering information on one alternative to gathering information on another alternative, and when individuals make a final choice. We develop an empirical model on this choice process, endogenizing the choice of which alternative the individual obtains information from at each point, and estimate the model with data from eye-tracking experiments. The em- pirical analysis yields empirical estimates of the relative size of search costs, switching costs, and informativeness of search for information. We then study the counterfactual of having lower search costs and switching costs, estimating the effect of greater length of time to make a decision and greater number of attention switches across alternatives. The model also delivers that there is a positive correlation between attention to an alternative and likelihood of that alternative being cho- sen, through the individuals choosing to learn more about the alternatives for which the individuals have beliefs of a higher preference.

"Interest Rate Misperception and Excess Borrowing in the Consumer Credit Market," with Xiao Yin ([draft](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4256372))
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Credit cards are usually advertised as financial products of conspicuous quality but with shrouded borrowing costs. We elicit consumer perceptions about the interest rate associated with credit-card borrowing. Combining bank account data and surveys, we find that consumers have very noisy perceptions about the true interest costs associated with credit card debt. Total borrowing decreases with perceived interest rates only for those with negative perception errors. Using an information treatment that informs the true costs of credit-card borrowing, we find that every percentage point decrease in the perceived rate increases borrowing by 143.1 US dollars.
