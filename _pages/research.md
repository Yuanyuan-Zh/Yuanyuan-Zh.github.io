"Interest Rate Misperception and Excess Borrowing in the Consumer Credit Market," with Xiao Yin ([draft](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4256372))
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Credit cards are usually advertised as financial products of conspicuous quality but with shrouded borrowing costs. We elicit consumer perceptions about the interest rate associated with credit-card borrowing. Combining bank account data and surveys, we find that consumers have very noisy perceptions about the true interest costs associated with credit card debt. Total borrowing decreases with perceived interest rates only for those with negative perception errors. Using an information treatment that informs the true costs of credit-card borrowing, we find that every percentage point decrease in the perceived rate increases borrowing by 143.1 US dollars.

"A Structural Model of Learning before Choice," with T. Tony Ke and J. Miguel Villas-Boas
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
(Preliminary) Consumers usually sequentially gather information before purchase decisions. We consider a Bayesian decision-maker choosing two alternatives with uncertain payoffs where she decides the learning effort among the products as well as the optimal stopping time. We leverage a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, proximal policy optimization (PPO), to solve the Markov decision process and utilize the corresponding optimal control to estimate the structural parameters of a decision-maker. These processes are helpful for marketers to design and evaluate shopping platforms and advertising strategies.
